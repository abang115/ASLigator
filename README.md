# ASLigator
ASLigator is a mobile app designed to bridge the communication gap between ASL and non-ASL signers. Leveraging computer vision (CV), advanced Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP), ASLigator will enable any user to point their camera at ASL gestures, translating them into understandable text instantly. This will ensure ASL signers can communicate effectively and naturally in their preferred language.
